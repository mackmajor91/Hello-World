# Hello-World
First program on GitHub

This is my first repo on GitHub. My name is Mack Major and I am currently a student at University of New Orleans taking undergraduate level CS classes with the purpose of applying to the Masters program. I graduated from Tulane University with a B.S. in Mathematics and have been working as a private math tutor since graduating. In addition to my passion for problem solving, I am a Drummer/Bandleader for multiple bands (CakeWalk, Hipnosis) in New Orleans that have played venues all over town. I love creating and collaborating with other humans as well as sharing my passion and knowledge for all things mathematical and musical.
